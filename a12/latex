\section*{Exercise 12, matrix copying}
We were tasked with initializing an array with copies of a matrix \texttt{mat} with only a \texttt{new} statement.

\subsection*{Solution}
Because the default constructor is always called we made a new class that is derived from matrix.
This \texttt{Copymatrix} holds a static \texttt{Matrix} that is used to initialize the class.
By returning a \texttt{Matrix} pointer the unnecessary data is sliced off.
