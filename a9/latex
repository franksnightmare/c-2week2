\section*{Exercise 9, inheritence and friends}
We had to solve a strange problem where a base class needed access to private functions of a derived class.
The fundamental problem is how to allow access to private member functions from two derivisions away.

\subsection*{Solution}
To solve this problem we made \texttt{Addition} and \texttt{Subtraction} friends of \texttt{Binops}.
Because \texttt{Operations} is derived from \texttt{Binops} this means that the friends of \texttt{Binops} are also friends of \texttt{Operations}.
So in this way the classes \texttt{Addition} and \texttt{Substraction} can use the private member functions \texttt{add} and \texttt{sub} of \texttt{Operations}.
